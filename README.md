Server developed in Linux Ubuntu server using the Cacti monitoring tool. In order to track the network infrastructure of a certain company and monitor the performance of its 5 sites. The implementation of the server allows centralized monitoring, visualizing the performance of the devices and early detection of possible problems such as power failures, massive disconnections, patch cord disconnection.

The impact of this project can be summarized in 5 items:

1. Guarantees continuous service: This real-time server allows timely and rapid detection of any damage to the network infrastructure and to be able to solve it, thus reducing downtime and guaranteeing continuous service.

2. Management Efficiency: Helps reduce downtime and allows quick solutions by alerts indicating when devices start to fail.

3. Time and resource savings: Detecting damage in a timely manner saves time and resources since solutions are made before the damage becomes critical and generates greater consequences.

4. Quality of service: The intranet provides effective service representing a greater satisfaction for end users.

5. Flexibility and scalability: The intranet network infrastructure can be expanded in the future.
